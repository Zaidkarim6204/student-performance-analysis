# Student Performance Analysis Dashboard in Python

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes student performance data using Python to uncover patterns and insights about how various factors affect academic achievement.  
It involves data cleaning, exploration, and visualization to present a clear understanding of the dataset.  

## 📂 Dataset
- *Name:* StudentsPerformance.csv  
- *Source:* Public dataset for academic performance analysis  
- *Features include:*
  - Gender  
  - Race/Ethnicity  
  - Parental level of education  
  - Lunch type  
  - Test preparation course  
  - Math score  
  - Reading score  
  - Writing score  

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
- *Python* – Data analysis and visualization  
- *NumPy* – Numerical computations  
- *Pandas* – Data cleaning & manipulation  
- *Matplotlib* – Data visualization  
- *Seaborn* – Statistical data visualization  

## 🔍 Analysis Steps
1. *Data Cleaning* – Removed null values and ensured proper data types.  
2. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* – Summary statistics, distributions, and correlations.  
3. *Visualization* – Bar charts, histograms, and heatmaps to show patterns in student performance.  

## 📊 Key Insights
- Female students scored higher on average in reading and writing.  
- Test preparation courses positively impacted scores.  
- Higher parental education levels correlated with better student performance.  
- Lunch type (standard vs. free/reduced) influenced scores.  

## 📈 Output
The final notebook provides visual dashboards and graphs showing how different factors influence student performance.
